The code shown here is the Monte Carlo code in the manuscript.

The scenarios include Fermi update process, conformity update rule, and myopic update rule. 

In this code, the parameter `bot_type` is used to control five scenarios involving different actions for bots, as mentioned in manuscript. `\rho` is the proportion of bots. `conformity_prob` is the probability of conformity of normal players, when `conformity_prob` is set to 0, it is equivalent to the individual being fully updated by Fermi rule. 

For more details about parameter setting in simulation, please refer to the comments in the code.
